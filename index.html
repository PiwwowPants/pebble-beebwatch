    <h1>Beebwatch for Pebble OS 1</h1>
    <p>
      Beebwatch comes in several different builds for the various options. Visit <a href="https://github.com/tomgidden/pebble-beebwatch/tree/os1/build">the list of builds</a> on your phone (or scan the QR code below); select the appropriate ".pbw" file; and then click "Raw" to download that build. You can install more than one build at once.

    <h1>Beebwatch for Pebble OS 2</h1>
    <p>
      The new Pebble OS and app allows the watchface to be reconfigured from the app itself, so only one build is needed. Click <a href="https://github.com/tomgidden/pebble-beebwatch/raw/os2/build/beebwatch-2.pbw">here</a> on your phone (or scan the QR code below) to install it.  Then, in the Pebble App's list of watchfaces, you should be able to click the round button to reconfigure it.
